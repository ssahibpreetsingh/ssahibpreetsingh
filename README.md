## PROJECTS

### Machine Learning for ASHRAE Building Energy Prediction ([View](https://jovian.com/ssahibpreetsingh/ashrae-great-energy-predictor))
- Cleaned & analyzed 6 CSVs with 43M+ rows & 16 columns to predict energy consumption
- Trained random forests and gradient boosted trees using scikit-learn, XGBoost & LightGBM
- Achieved an RMSLE error of 1.088, landing in the top 38% on Kaggle & identified key features


### Deep Learning - Predicting Age, Gender and  Ethnicity ([View](https://jovian.com/ssahibpreetsingh/age-gender-ethnicity-predictor))
- Built a CNN and trained over 23K images to predict the Age, Gender and Ethnicity of the person.
- Model Built-in Pytorch along with implementation of Data Augmentation, Batch Normalization, Learning Rate Scheduling, Weight Decay, gradient clipping, Relu activations & Dropout to achieve the best results
- Achieved accuracy of 85% for ethnicity and 93% for gender classification and RMSE of 7 for Age.


### Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisation Air Pollution Data ([View](https://jovian.com/ssahibpreetsingh/air-pollution-data-analysis))
- Analyzed air pollution data for 1 million+ rows & 50+ columns by merging 4 datasets using Pandas
- Created visualizations (histogram, treemap, polar chart, displot, heatmap, etc.) using Seaborn & Plotly
- Discovered why air quality is better in summer than winter by comparing air pollution & weather data
